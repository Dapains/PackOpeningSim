# PackOpeningSim
There have been simulating pack opening for various card games and even other video games. The goal of this program is through the help of multiple card game databases and api's to make a simulator that encompasses the primary three trading card games being Pokemon, Yugioh, and Magic the Gathering. The program should work by selecting the game you want to open, then the printing set and it should let you open a pack containing cards from that set and display them. more features will be added as this is done.
